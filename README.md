2022 trimester 2 practical 1

This practical creates a simple html page with simple script elements.
The page has a heading and a button. Clicking the button will change the text of the heading and it will change both the text colour and background colour.
The text and colour is randomly selected from the array of options. There is a check to prevent the text colour matching the background colour.
